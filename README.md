# BookListing

This app helps users to find a set of books related to a specific topic.

The user enter a book genre (or topic) on the search page to get a list of ten books related to that topic. 

The app queries the Google Books API to find the books.  
 
By clicking on one of the items returned by the API, the User is redirected 
to the book's Webpage.
